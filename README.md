## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "Authentication failed" errors**
- Verify your API token is correct and hasn't expired
- Ensure your email address matches your Zendesk account
- Check that your subdomain is spelled correctly (no `.zendesk.com` suffix)

**❌ "Permission denied" errors**
- Verify your Zendesk user has Agent permissions or higher
- Ensure API access is enabled for your account
- Check if your token has the required scopes

**❌ "Server not found" errors**
- Ensure you've installed the package: `npm install -g zd-mcp-server`
- Try using npx instead: `npx zd-mcp-server`
- Check that your MCP client configuration file syntax is correct

**❌ "Environment variables not set" errors**
- Verify all three environment variables are set: `ZENDESK_EMAIL`, `ZENDESK_TOKEN`, `ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN`
- Restart your MCP client after setting environment variables
- Check for typos in environment variable names

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
DEBUG=zd-mcp-server:* zd-mcp-server
```

### Log Files

Check MCP client logs:
- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%/Claude/logs/` (Windows)
- **Cursor**: Check the output panel for MCP server logs
- **Terminal**: Run server directly to see real-time logs

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Search Query Syntax

Zendesk search supports powerful query operators:

```bash
# Status-based searches
status:open status:pending status:solved

# Priority searches  
priority:urgent priority:high priority:normal priority:low

# Date-based searches
created>2024-01-01 updated<2024-01-31

# Tag searches
tags:billing tags:technical-issue

# Requester searches
requester:customer@company.com

# Resource type filtering
type:ticket type:user type:organization type:group

# Complex combinations
status:open priority:high created>2024-01-01 tags:billing
```

### Enhanced Search Parameters

The search tool now supports advanced filtering and pagination options:

```bash
# Pagination
per_page: 1-100 results per page (default: 100)
page: Page number for pagination (starts from 1)

# Sorting
sort_by: Field to sort by (created_at, updated_at, priority, status, ticket_type, etc.)
sort_order: asc (ascending) or desc (descending)

# Resource type filtering
type: ticket, user, organization, or group

# Example usage
"Search for open tickets, 25 per page, page 2, sorted by priority descending"
"Find all users, sorted by creation date, show first 50 results"
"Search urgent tickets from last month, sorted by update date"
```

### Batch Operations

While the server doesn't directly support batch operations, you can chain commands:

```
"Search for all urgent tickets, then show me details for the first 3 results"
"Find tickets tagged 'billing', update them to normal priority, and add a note about the billing system maintenance"
```
